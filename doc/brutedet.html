<h1>Simple bruteforce detection tool</h1>
<p><i>Last updated: June 9th, 2014</i></p>
<p></p><h2>Synopsis</h2>
On this page you'll find a simple, drop-in bruteforce detection program.
 It's a very lightweight implementation in portable C and it doesn't 
require any external dependencies besides a standard C library. It 
should run under all modern POSIX-like systems (Linux, *BSD etc).
The actual program doesn't know anything about IP addressess or the 
structure of the data that's being fed into it. One simply feeds textual
 lines of data to its standard input. This data is then fed into a 
counting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>
 for
three specific time buckets. There's a time bucket for a 10 second 
period, a 60 second period and a 10 minute period. The tresholds for 
each bucket are user configurable and once a treshold is reached a 
bruteforce attempt is detected and a supplied command will be executed. 
One can then for example add a firewall rule to block a certain IP 
address.
<p></p>
<p>
The tool is just <b><i>quick proof of concept</i></b> but it might be 
useful when one doesn't have the time and resources to add integrated 
bruteforce detection to a possibly very complex web application stack. 
It's easy to filter for, say, very CPU-intensive URL's and set specific 
tresholds for those URL's. Two examples of usage of the tool are 
provided below; one in which a webserver is protected and another 
example in which TCP SYN scans are detected.
</p>
<p></p><h2>Usage</h2><p></p>
<p>Since the tool does not keep track of which IP's were banned nor 
when, it cannot unban those IP's either. To get this functionality one 
can simply use <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>. After installing fail2ban open up <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code> and add the following lines:
</p><pre>[brutedet]
enabled = true
filter  = brutedet
logpath = /var/log/brutedet.log
action  = iptables-allports
maxretry = 1
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Then create <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/brutedet.conf</code> with the following content:
</p><pre>[Definition]
failregex = &lt;HOST&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Create the file <code>/var/log/brutedet.log</code> and make sure it's readable by the credentials fail2ban runs under.</p>
<p>Reload the fail2ban rules by running <code>fail2ban-client reload</code> and make sure there are no errors being displayed.</p>
<h3>URL-based bruteforce protection</h3>
<p>Now we are ready to start parsing HTTP log files and feed the data into the tool. First we disable any buffering and we run
a <code>tail -f</code> on the logfile of our webserver such as this:
</p><pre>$ stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 tail -f /var/log/fnord/current
@40000000538e48a02e25609c x.x.x.x 200 3453 santarago.org:80 Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0 none /brutedet.html
@40000000538e48a13b676b9c x.x.x.x 304 0 santarago.org:80 Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0 none /brutedet.html
@40000000538e48af23f7c95c x.x.x.x 200 3467 santarago.org:80 Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0 none /brutedet.html
@40000000538e48e11a24871c x.x.x.x 200 3585 santarago.org:80 Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0 none /brutedet.html
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
To extract the IP addresses and, for example, the user-agent data we pipe the preceding output through <code>awk</code> akin to:
</p><pre>$ stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 tail -f /var/log/fnord/current | \
awk -W interactive '{print $2 " " $6}'
x.x.x.x Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0
x.x.x.x Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0
x.x.x.x Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0
x.x.x.x Mozilla/5.0_(Windows_NT_6.1;_WOW64;_rv:29.0)_Gecko/20100101_Firefox/29.0
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The preceding data should now be piped into the tool. Let's settle 
for allowing a maximum of 5 requests from a specific IP every 10 
seconds, a maximum of 10 requests every minute and a maximum of 20 
requests every ten minutess. This means we run the tool with <code>./brutedet 5 10 20 &lt;cmd&gt;</code>.
For the command which will be executed we need to output the IP address 
and the date as this is a fail2ban requirement. We specify the command 
as a long string. Before execution every occurence of the word <code>KEY</code>
 is replaced with the actual IP address. In the aforementioned fail2ban 
configuration we set up fail2ban such that it would read its input for 
the bruteforce detection jail from the file <code>/var/log/brutedet.log</code>. This means that the command needs to write out the IP and the date to that specific file. This results in a command like <code>(printf 'KEY ' &amp;&amp; date) &gt;&gt; /var/log/brutedet.log</code>. The entire resulting command will then become the following:
</p><pre>$ stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 tail -f /var/log/fnord/current | \
awk -W interactive '{print $2 " " $6}' | \
./brutedet 5 10 20 "(printf 'KEY ' &amp;&amp; date) &gt;&gt; /var/log/brutedet.log"
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
With the preceding command running we can now fire up a browser and 
request a url more than 5 times in 10 seconds. If everything went 
according to plan an entry will be written to <code>/var/log/brutedet.log</code>. This entry will be picked up by fail2ban which will automatically add a firewall rule using iptables and write a log entry to <code>/var/log/fail2ban.log</code>. After some time this IP will automatically become unbanned as per the fail2ban configuration:
</p><pre>2014-06-03 23:28:24,377 fail2ban.actions: WARNING [brutedet] Ban x.x.x.x
2014-06-03 23:38:24,797 fail2ban.actions: WARNING [brutedet] Unban x.x.x.x
</pre>
If you want you can also have more advanced filters by inserting for example a <code>grep</code>
 command with the appropriate filters in the command. Say that one has a
 webservice that has an API call which always takes 30 seconds to 
complete because it's very CPU/resource intensive. By filtering out 
these requests and only piping these through to the tool one has the 
ability to quickly do bruteforce detecting for these URL's without 
having to introduce this throttling functionality in the web application
 stack itself.
<p></p>
<h3>Detecting SYN floods</h3>
<p>
You can also use the tool to automatically detect SYN floods. By using someting like <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">tshark</a>
 one can filter out SYN packets quite easily and apply limits to how 
often a SYN packet will be accepted from a specific IP before the source
 IP will be blocked by fail2ban.
</p><pre>tshark -i eth0 -l -R "tcp.flags==0x02" "tcp" | \
awk -W interactive '{print $2 " " $2}' | \
./brutedet 5 10 20 "(printf 'KEY ' &amp;&amp; date) &gt;&gt; /var/log/brutedet.log"
</pre>

<p></p>
<p></p><h2>Compilation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="http://santarago.org/brutedet.tgz">code</a>.</li>
<li>Run the following commands: <code>tar zxvf brutedet.tgz &amp;&amp; cd brutedet &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; ./brutedet</code></li>
<li>This should result in seeing the usage screen which looks something like this:
<pre>not enough (or too many) arguments supplied

./brutedet [options] &lt;t1&gt; &lt;t2&gt; &lt;t3&gt; "echo added KEY"

Parameters t1, t2, t3 are the integer tresholds for the 10 second-,
1 minute-, 10 minute-bucket respectively.

The last argument is the command to execute once a treshold
is passed. The word KEY will be replaced with the key in the
bloomfilter. This will most likely be an IP address.

Options:
 -c &lt;capacity&gt;        bloom filter capacity (default: 100000)
 -e &lt;error rate&gt;      allowed error rate(default: 0.010)
 -h                    help (this screen)

The following example echo's a warning to a logfile
and it will accept a maximum of 5 requests every 10 seconds,
a maximum of 20 requests every minute and a maximum of 40
requests every 10 minutes.

./brutedet 5 20 40 "echo treshold reached for KEY &gt;&gt; /tmp/logfile.txt"
