In this tarball you'll find a simple, drop-in bruteforce detection program.
It's a very lightweight implementation in portable C and it doesn't require any
external dependencies besides a standard C library. It should run under all
modern POSIX-like systems (Linux, *BSD etc). The actual program doesn't know
anything about IP addressess or the structure of the data that's being fed into
it. One simply feeds textual lines of data to it's standard input. This data is
then fed into a counting Bloom filter for three specific time buckets. There's
a time bucket for a 10 second period, a 60 second period and a 10 minute
period. The tresholds for each bucket are user configurable and once a treshold
is reached a bruteforce attempt is detected and a supplied command will be
executed. One can then for example add a firewall rule to block a certain IP
address.

The tool is just quick proof of concept but it might be useful when one doesn't
have the time and resources to add integrated bruteforce detection to possibly
very complex web application stack. It's easy to filter for, say, very
CPU-intensive URL's and set specific tresholds for those URL's. 

More information regarding usage of the tool can be found at the included HTML
